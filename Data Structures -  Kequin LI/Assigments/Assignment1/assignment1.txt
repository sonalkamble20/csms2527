Assignment #1
Due date: February 3, 2025


Write a program
(1) to read a list of exam scores (integers in the range 0..100) and
(2) to compute the total number of grades and the number of grades in each letter-grade category:

A: 90-100
B: 80-89
C: 70-79
D: 60-69
F: 0-59

The end of the input is indicated by a negative integer as a sentinel value.

For example, if the input is
75 63 87 84 71 92 81 50 78 65 76 98 74 85 72 66 -1

the output would be:

Total number of grades = 16
Number of A's = 2
Number of B's = 4
Number of C's = 6
Number of D's = 3
Number of F's = 1
