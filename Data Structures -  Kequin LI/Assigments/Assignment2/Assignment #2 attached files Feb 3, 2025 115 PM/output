Supply the following numbers to s:
0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 

The information of statistician s is
  length = 10
  sum = 45.0
  mean = 4.5
  minimum = 0.0
  maximum = 9.0

Supply the following numbers to t:
0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 9.0 8.5 8.0 7.5 7.0 

The information of statistician t is
  length = 10
  sum = 45.0
  mean = 4.5
  minimum = 0.0
  maximum = 9.0

s equals to t

The information of statistician t after t.clear() is
  length = 0
  sum = 0.0
  mean = NaN
  minimum = NaN
  maximum = NaN

Supply the following numbers to t:
0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 9.5 10.0
