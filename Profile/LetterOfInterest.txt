Dear Alana,

I am excited to apply for the Graduate Assistant position in Graduate Admissions at SUNY New Paltz. As a graduate student pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science, I am eager to leverage my strong organizational, communication, and creative skills to support the department's goals.

In my previous roles, I have gained experience in social media management, event promotion, and administrative duties. I am comfortable creating engaging content on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, and I have experience with tools such as Excel and Canva. Additionally, my attention to detail and ability to meet deadlines will help ensure that tasks like managing calendars, conducting research, and assisting with event support are executed efficiently.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the Graduate Admissions team and would love to discuss how my skills can support your efforts. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Sonal Kamble
